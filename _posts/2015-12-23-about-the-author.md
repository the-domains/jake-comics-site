# About the author

_Jake Wyatt_

Necropolis is written and drawn by Jake Wyatt with guidance and assistance from Kathryn Wyatt. The site updates on Wednesday evenings, usually with a new page of the comic.

You can find Jake on Tumblr at [http://jakewyattriot.tumblr.com/][0]. He posts mostly drawings.

You cannot find Kathryn on Tumblr. She likes her privacy.

We hope you enjoy our comic.
